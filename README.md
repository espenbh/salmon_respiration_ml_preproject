# Salmon breathing evaluation by deep learning
In this repository I have included all code used in my salmon ventilation deep learning pipeline. Data is not included, so the code does not run unless data is included and map structure changed apropriately. 
The train_network.salmon-keypoint-detection notebook was trained using kaggle, and it require scripts from the pyvision github page: https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/detection.
