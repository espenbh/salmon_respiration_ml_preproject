# Salmon breathing evaluation by deep learning
- In this repository I have included all code used in my salmon ventilation deep learning pipeline. Data and trained model is not included.
- The train_network\\salmon-keypoint-detection notebook was trained using kaggle, and it require scripts from the pyvision github page: https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/detection.
