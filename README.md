# Salmon breathing evaluation by deep learning
- In this repository I have included all code used in my salmon ventilation deep learning pipeline. Data and trained model are not included.
- The train_network\\salmon-keypoint-detection notebook was trained using kaggle, and it requires scripts from the pytorch/vision github page: https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/detection.
- Labelme was used for manual annotation: https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/releases
